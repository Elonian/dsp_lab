## The data folder was split into two folder (input_data.zip and output_data.zip) due to max file size error (for uploading)
## While running the codes please unzip both of them and add it to a newly created data floder in the same project.
### OR
## Create a new data folder(in same project) and run ee18btech11030_dat.py file then remaining ploting files will work fine
